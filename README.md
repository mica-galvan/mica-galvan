<p>
Frontend Developer with experience in startups and social-impact projects across Latin America.
Since 2021, I’ve worked on web development projects building MVPs, platforms, and digital products, mainly focused on frontend development with occasional fullstack tasks.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy working at the intersection of technology, design, sustainability, and social impact. 
Collaborating with diverse, remote teams helped me develop a strong understanding of business processes, teamwork, and product-oriented development.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I work as an independent developer, collaborating remotely on different projects while continuing to strengthen my skills in JavaScript, frontend frameworks, Python, and databases.
